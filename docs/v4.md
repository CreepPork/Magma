# Magma Version 4 Specification

## Features

### Proper separation from local and Steam mods

Mods must be separated from the main mods to better improve the development. This is resolved by using a polymorphic relationship.

### Added support for presets

This is heavily overdue because lots of times, mods can be switched around for different missions and mod activation/decativation was broken in v3 and without having to remove them from disk can be a very handy tool.

### Shared folder for Steam mods

Sometimes users may have multiple servers and having a central mod store will reduce disk usage.
